# Anything - The Permissionless Agent Marketplace

We have learned our lesson.
App stores should be free and open.
Never again.

### Plan

1. Create Database of AI Agents.
2. Build friendly API for anyone to integrate agent discovery and listing into their systems.
3. Build and deploy base marketplace protocol to Sui Mainnet May 2023.
4. Onboard web2 Database onto web3 protocol.
5. Integrate payments for agents into base protocol.
6. Build python library for easily getting paid for agents.
7. Integrate reviews into base protocol.
8. Make all protocol functionality available via easy API.

### Guiding Thoughts

People don't like crypto. Crypto is hard to use. The goal is to have the simplest system possible for our goals not some massively complex system.

The purpose is a database of apps everyone can use and no one has control over.

A free on open marketplace or app store for agents builds a foundation for a high quality ecosystem of businesses, SDK's and value creation.

#### We should aim to create value where it makes natural sense at the protocol level where it is not easy for individuals to provide it.

- Listings
- Payments
- Reviews

And Anyting that makes that dead simple for builders to leverage everywhere.
